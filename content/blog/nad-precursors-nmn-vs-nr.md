NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a critical coenzyme found in every cell of your body. As we age, NAD+ levels naturally decline, which has been linked to various aspects of aging.

## Understanding NMN

Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is a direct precursor to NAD+. Studies have shown it can effectively raise NAD+ levels in various tissues.

## Understanding NR

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is another NAD+ precursor that has been extensively studied. It converts to NMN before becoming NAD+.

## Which Should You Choose?

The choice between NMN and NR depends on various factors including cost, availability, and individual response. Both have shown promise in research settings.
