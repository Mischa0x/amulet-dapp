The AMULET token serves as the native utility token of the Amulet AI platform, providing holders with discounted access to compute credits and governance rights.

## Token Utility

AMULET holders can stake their tokens to receive compute credits at 2x the fiat rate, effectively cutting AI interaction costs in half.

## 2026 Roadmap

This year we're focused on mainnet deployment, expanded staking options, and introducing governance features for token holders.
